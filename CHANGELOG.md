## [4.1.9] - 2023-11-17
### Changed
- Introduced some major design changes:
    - Included chat bubbles for the user and GPT and gave it a "chat-like" feel
    - Support even better response for mobile view

## [4.2.0] - 2023-11-17
### Added
- Replaced the buttons with icons

## [5.0.0] - 2023-11-18
### Changed
- Answers now also get automatically played on mobile.
(This got achieved by including the playing of a silent audio file. It gets played directly each time the "Speak in your prompt" button gets pressed.)
(During testing this worked 99% of the time, rarely the text did not get played automatically. I suspect this has something to do with no implementation of a "OnTouch" method.
TODO: Further inspect this for later.)
- Added a welcoming screen with a button. Upon pressing the access for the microphone gets requested to enhance the user experience.
TODO: What happens if the user says no with the microphone?? Handle this case as well!!
If the user grants access all the other elements also get rendered.
TODO: Precisely test this with VoiceOver!!
