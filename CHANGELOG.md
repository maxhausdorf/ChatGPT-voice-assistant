### Changed

    - Included chat bubbles for the user and GPT and gave it a "chat-like" feel
    - Support even better response for mobile view

## [4.2.0] - 2023-11-17
### Added
- Replaced the buttons with icons

## [5.0.0] - 2023-11-18
### Changed
- Answers now also get automatically played on mobile.
(This got achieved by including the playing of a silent audio file. It gets played directly each time the "Speak in your prompt" button gets pressed.)
(During testing this worked 99% of the time, rarely the text did not get played automatically. I suspect this has something to do with no implementation of a "OnTouch" method.
TODO: Further inspect this for later.)
- Added a welcoming screen with a button. Upon pressing the access for the microphone gets requested to enhance the user experience.
TODO: What happens if the user says no with the microphone?? Handle this case as well!!
If the user grants access all the other elements also get rendered.
TODO: Precisely test this with VoiceOver!!

On mobile I left the Menu Overview (for now, further discuss this though, maybe it is not even needed to be there visually?)
### Changed

## [6.6.1] - 2023-12-18
### Changed
- Sidebar is only visible when application got started (Start Application Button got pressed)

## [6.6.2] - 2023-12-30
### Changed
- When Microphone access gets rejected, a "refresh page" message gets shown with a button
### Changed

If no content is available then "No chats available" gets displayed.
### Changed
- Included the audio controls directly inside of a chat message.
### Removed
- Got rid of the "Prompt" and "Answer from ChatGPT" headers in the header chat. (Could remove the header chat completely now...)

## [7.0.0] - 2024-01-28
### Changed
- Changed the initial message to the system. (response should not be longer than 100 words)
### Added
- Added a delete button to manually delete the chat history. History does not get deleted anymore when application gets started.
### Added
- Investigated the possibility to adapt the timeouts durations of the speech. So e.g. how long there should be no voice input until the
app thinks you finished your speech. Does not work properly though, apparently this is a known issue.
### Changed
- Changed error message when no voice input happened to "ERROR: Speech could not be recognized. Wait for the audio signal to finish and start speaking."
### Added
- Added a whole new navigation system with a collapse functionality. There are now two main navigation buttons. 1. Chat-GPT-Voice-Assistant and 2. Chat Navigation. The first one gives access to the chat history and to create a new chat. The second one allows to collapse the current navigation.
### Changed
- Changed the focus setting such that the top button gets focused on when the microphone access got granted on mobile.
### Changed
- Adapted the header structure. The user and assistant "Chat Bubbles" are now different. The user chat bubble does not have a paragraph anymore because prompts
tend to be shorter than the answer - the prompt is now included in the heading. The audio controls are not in the heading element.
This is different for the system, here the audio controls are included in the heading element and the response is still in a pragraph element.
### Changed
- The chat history is now an unsorted list with list items. There is a ref to determine the first list item such that the focus can be set on it when opening the history.
### Changed
- A collapsible now is wrapped in a h1 element if it gets specified to be a header.
### Changed
- "Speak in your prompt" button now is called "Speak in" button
### Changed
- Removed the footer with the versioning.

## [7.0.1] - 2024-01-28
### Changed
- Changed maxToken value (which handles the length of the prompt output) such that prompts get generated faster.
TODO: test out how low this value can be without badly influencing the user experience.

## [7.1.0] - 2024-01-29
### Changed
- As some responses include unfinished sentences at the end, the unfinished part gets cut off up until the last dot. This got caused by the token limit.
